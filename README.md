# Note-taking app in Next.js
From Frontend Masters course: Intro to Next.js 
Resources:
* [Course Notes](https://hendrixer.github.io/)
* [Github Repository](https://)

Stopping point (ran into problems with ThemeUI): [Pausing here](https://hendrixer.github.io/hextjs-course/themeui)

The course is a couple years out of date and has issues with more-recent versions of React and various Node modules.

## My notes:

To start server: `npm run dev`
